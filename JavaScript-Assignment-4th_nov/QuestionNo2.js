/* Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.

Solution:- 

Operators in JavaScript are cateorized based on their functionality into the followin roups:

1.arithmetic Operators: These operators perform mathematical operations on operands. Operands can be
numbers or variables. /** */

 //addition(+)
 const sum = 1+2
 console.log("addition of two number :", sum)
 //subtraction(-)
 const sub = 25-9
 console.log("Subtraction of two number ", sub)
 //Multipliction (*)
 const mul = 2*8
 console.log("Multiplication of two number ", mul)
 //division (/)
 const div = 8/2
console.log("Division of tow number ", div)
//Exponentiation(**)
const power = 2**3
console.log("power of the number")
//Modulo(%)
const mod = 54%14
console.log("modulo of two number  ", mod)


//2. Assignment  Operators: These operators assin values to variables 
// Assignment operator (=)
const myVariable = 10;
// Addition assignment operator (+=)
myVariable += 5; // myVariable is now equal to 15
// Subtraction assignment operator (-=)
myVariable -= 5; // myVariable is now equal to 10
// Multiplication assignment operator (*=)
myVariable *= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 20
// Division assignment operator (/=)
myVariable /= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 10
// Modulo assignment operator (%=)
myVariable %= 3; // myVariable is now equal to 1

//3. Comparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false).

// Equal to (==)
const isEqual = 10 == 10; // isEqual is now equal to true
// Not equal to (!=)
const isNotEqual = 10 != 10; // isNotEqual is now equal to false
// Greater than (>)
const isGreaterThan = 10 > 5; // isGreaterThan is now equal to true
// Less than (<)
const isLessThan = 10 < 5; // isLessThan is now equal to false
// Greater than or equal to (>=)
const isGreaterThanOrEqual = 10 >= 10; // isGreaterThanOrEqual is now equal to
true
// Less than or equal to (<=)
const isLessThanOrEqual = 10 <= 5; // isLessThanOrEqual is now equal to false

//4. Logical Operators: These operators perform logical operations on Boolean values
// AND (&&)
const isAndTrue = true && true; // isAndTrue is now equal to true
const isAndFalse = true && false; // isAndFalse is now equal to false
// OR (||)
const isOrTrue = true || false; // isOrTrue is now equal to true
const isOrFalse = false || false; // isOrFalse is now equal to false
// NOT (!)
const isNotTrue = !true; // isNotTrue is now equal to false
const isNotFalse = !false; // isNotFalse is now equal to true
