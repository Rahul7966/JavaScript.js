1.What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

ans:

Conditional statements are used in programming to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
These statements evaluate expressions and, depending on whether the condition is True or False, the program 
executes certain blocks of code.

Common Conditional Statements
    if statement: It executes a block of code if the condition is true.
    else statement: It follows an if statement and executes when the if condition is false.
    elif (else if) statement: It checks multiple conditions after the if statement.

Syntax and Examples
    1. if Statement
        The if statement checks a condition, and if itâ€™s true, the block of code is executed.

    if Statement syntax:
        if condition{
            block of code
        }
            
    examples:
        let x = 10
        if (x > 5){
             console.log("x is greater than 5");
        }
           

    2. else if Statement:
        The else if statement comes after if statement. When multiple condition is there then this condition are must be needed. 
        when if statement is flase then else if statement executed.

    else if statement syntax:
        if condition{
            block of code
        }
            
        else if{
            block of code 
        }
            
        
    examples:
        let x = 5
        if (x > 10){
            console.log("x is greater than 10")
        }
            
        else if(x == 5){
             console.log("x is equal to 5");
        }
           


    3. Else statement:
        else statement comes after when if condition and else  condition both are false then this condition 
        will executed

    else statement syntax:
        if(condition){
            block of code
        }
            
        else if(condition){
            block of code 
        }
            
        else{
            block of code 
        }
            
    
    examples:
        let x = 5
        if (x > 10){
            console.log("x is greater than 10");
        }
            
        else if(x == 5){
            console.log("x is equal to 5");
        }
            
        else:
            console.log("x is less than 5");
