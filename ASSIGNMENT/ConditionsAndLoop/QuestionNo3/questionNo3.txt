3.What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

Ans:-

    Loops are programming structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. 
    They are essential when you need to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating over a list of items, executing a set of 
    instructions a specific number of times, or processing user input.

    Without loops, you would need to write the same code over and over again, which is inefficient. Loops help make your code 
    more concise and easier to maintain.

Types of Loops in javaScript 
    1. for loop: ------
        for loop is commonly used when you know how many times you want to iterate through a block of code.
        
        syntax:--------
            for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                // Code to be executed
            }

        examples:-------
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                console.log(i);
            }
    2. While Loop: ---------
        The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. The loop runs as long as 
        the condition is true.

        syntax:--------
        while (condition) {
            // Code to be executed
        }

        examples:-------
            let i = 0;
            while (i < 5) {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }

    3. Do While Loop :-----------
        The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the code block is executed at least 
        once, even if the condition is false.
    
        syntax:-----
            do{
                //code to be executed
            }while(condition);

        examples:-------
            let i = 0;
            do{
                console.log(i);
                i++;
            }while(i<5);

    4. For ....in Loop:------
        The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

        syntax:-------
            for(key in object){
                // code to be executed
            }
        examples:------

            const person = {name: "Rahul", age: 22, city: "Durgapur"};
            for (let key in person) {
            console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
            }



    ---------------:Why do we needs loop:------------------
    
    Efficiency: Loops help in reducing the amount of code you need to write for repetitive tasks.
    Automation: Tasks like iterating through data structures or automating processes can be easily handled using loops.
    Flexibility: Loops allow dynamic decision-making, enabling code to run based on conditions rather than manually writing each step.
